# Repository for some of the projects developed during the DNC Data Expert formation

In this repository, you will find a few projects that were developed through my data science formation at DNC Group.
Some of them may not be complete, or very well structured, given some facts:

* They were made while i was still learning to develop those kinds of projects;
* They always had a short timelog, something like a hackathon most times, so they may be incomplete due to the fact that they had to be delivered in time;
* Some of them are the answers of the assignments of the course, and may or may not have all the questions that were given to us writen down.

So...

Keep in mind this is a repository that marks the start of a long and very exciting journey through the data science world, and although 
they do not reflect the programmer or data scientist that i am today, they are part of my history, and i wanna keep them on my GitHub to 
always remind me of how far i've gone and how much i've improved in this field. 

I'm very thankful for all the knowledge that the DNC Group teachers and colleagues gave me, and i'll carry them with me for all my journey.
